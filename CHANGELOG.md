## Version 0.3.0

- Allow setting the list of services in the env file. Removed the defaults.
- Added Dockerfile but not functional. The logon redirect seems to be getting lost when run from docker. Would welcome feedback/help/tips. Will debug after I publish the blog associated with restaf-docker-demo.

## Version 0.2.0

- setting cookiedomain to none to support Edge (atleast that is the theory)
